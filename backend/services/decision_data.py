"""Declared decision questions, kept apart from the code that asks them.

Everything here is data. Each entry is one closed question that a decision
point can put to a model instead of (or in shadow beside) its regex: the
wording, the allowed answers, what goes in the state and where each field
comes from, the deterministic fallback, the safe side, and the floor a model
has to reach on the labelled set before the decision may be switched on.

Nothing imports this module at runtime yet. Every entry defaults to "off".

Field reference

    state         {field: (source, max_chars)}; source is system | user |

Measured rows live in MEASURED_ACCURACY, keyed by decision. A row holds only
for the model build (``digest``, the Ollama manifest digest prefix) and the
exact wording (``wording_sha``, see backend/tests/unit/test_decision_data.py)
it was measured with; editing the key, instructions or choices voids it.
