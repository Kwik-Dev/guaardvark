"""Source watch: Guaardvark notices when its own code changes, however it changed.

The inbound guard judges changes at the doors it knows about — merges, its own
edits, the editor. This sweeps the code itself, so a change that came in some
other way is seen too. It covers the checkout's code (tracked, and untracked
files git does not ignore), every file the Interconnector serves to other
machines, and the surfaces listed under "watch" in inbound_rules.json (ComfyUI
custom nodes, extensions, the agent's notes and MCP server list).

Each file keeps its last judged state in ``inbound_baselines``. A sweep hashes
what changed (size and mtime first) and attributes each change:

- git: the file now matches HEAD. Merges are judged by the git hooks.
- product: the product wrote it through a guarded path, which judged it and
  updated the baseline when it landed.
- out-of-band: anything else. The file is read whole and only findings that
  were not there before are raised; a hold goes to the review list.

The first sweep reads everything once as an audit, recorded for a person to
read; it holds nothing. On the master, files still held are withheld from what
the Interconnector serves while the guard enforces, so only swept code leaves
this machine.
