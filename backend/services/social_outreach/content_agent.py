"""
Content agent — Phase 2 of the multi-agent outreach pipeline.

Walks status="candidate" rows produced by Recon, asks the LLM (via the
existing persona helpers) to draft a comment that fits the thread and
the feature hint, grades the draft, and transitions the row's status:
  - candidate → drafted (grade ≥ MIN_GRADE)
  - candidate → rejected (grade < MIN_GRADE, or empty draft, or error)

Self-contained: reads everything from the candidate row's draft_text JSON
payload (which Recon populates with title, selftext_preview, top_comments,
feature_hint). No live Reddit fetch — that was Recon's job.

Doesn't post. Doesn't call the servo. The servo path is Phase 3 (Outreach),
which already exists in tick_process_approved_drafts. When unsupervised
(kill on, not supervised, grade ≥ MIN_GRADE, cadence OK, independent check
ran and passed), Content promotes straight to ``approved`` — same would_post
gate as /draft-comment — so YouTube chain-draft matches Reddit unsupervised
behavior.
