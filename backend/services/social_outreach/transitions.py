"""Status transitions for social outreach draft rows.

    candidate -> drafted -> approved -> processing -> submitting -> posted
                                             |              |
    rejected <- (candidate, drafted,         +--> aborted <-+
                 approved, processing)

``processing`` means a poster has claimed the row and is driving the browser
towards the composer; the row can still be rejected. ``submitting`` means the
poster has started the step that publishes, which cannot be taken back.

Every change of status goes through ``move``, a compare-and-set in one UPDATE,
so a reject and a poster racing for the same row cannot both win: either the
reject lands and ``begin_submit`` refuses, or the submit has begun and the
reject is refused.

While public posting is stopped (``kill_switch.posting_stop_reason``),
``claim`` and ``begin_submit`` refuse and an approved draft stays approved, so
it waits for the stop to lift rather than being abandoned.
