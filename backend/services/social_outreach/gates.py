"""
What the independent check concluded about an outreach draft.

Every draft waits for a person's approval; no grade, however good, posts one.
The drafter grades its own text, and that score leans toward whatever it just
wrote, so a second model (external_grader) checks it blind. Its answer is
recorded with the draft for the person who reviews it; a draft that failed
the check is marked so they can see why.

Only a build of another model family counts as an independent check
(decision_data.INDEPENDENCE). A grader that resolves to the drafter's own
build (same Ollama manifest digest) or to another build of its family still
reports its answer, but a pass from it is labelled not_independent, never
passed.

A self-share has no thread for the rubric to judge, so it is never graded.

Used by content_agent (Recon candidates) and POST /draft-comment (Reddit loop,
self-share, Discord cog, Outreach page).
