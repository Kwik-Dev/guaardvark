"""Platform-agnostic poster — drive the general agent loop to post anywhere.

The founding principle: put the work into the hand/eye/brain and the platform
stops mattering. Modern models already know how Reddit, X, YouTube, and Facebook
compose boxes work; the grounded eye (DOM element inventory in the decision
prompt) tells the brain what's actually on THIS page. So instead of a hand-written
BiDi poster per platform, one NL-driven loop finds the composer, types the text,
and submits — on any site the operator is logged into.

Used for platforms without a dedicated calibrated fast-path (X/Twitter, Facebook).
Reddit and YouTube keep their existing BiDi posters for now; once this loop is
live-verified they can migrate here too, and "adding a platform" becomes "log in".

Contract mirrors reddit_outreach.post_comment_via_servo: returns (success, reason).
