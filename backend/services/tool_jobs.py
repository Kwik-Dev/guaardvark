"""Background runs of tool calls that an MCP client polls instead of waiting on.

An MCP client stops waiting for a call after the server's timeout (120 s by
default), and some tools take longer: a Qwen-Image-Edit runs about three
minutes on a 16 GB card. For those tools the MCP server hands the call to the
backend (``run_tool_in_backend``); the backend checks the inputs, starts the
work here on a thread, and answers at once with a job id that
``get_generation_status`` reads (in process, or over GET /api/tools/jobs/<id>).
The work then no longer depends on the client: closing the MCP session does not
stop it.

Chat, the Studio and the Tools page run the same tools in the backend and wait
for them inline; they never come through here.

Jobs live in this process's memory. Every job id carries a token of the backend
process that started it, so after a restart a reader can say that the job
belonged to the previous run instead of claiming it never existed.
