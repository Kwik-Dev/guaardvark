"""The job arbiter: one place that decides which waiting job may start next.

Guaardvark has many queues (Celery, the batch FIFOs, the render requeues, the
GPU gate's own wait) and each keeps its own order. The arbiter does not
replace them. A job still waits in its own loop; before it claims the GPU,
and at the safe points of background work, it asks the arbiter whether it is
its turn. The arbiter answers from one ledger shared by every process on the
box (backend, Celery workers, sidecars), so the answer is the same wherever
the job runs.

What it decides, with the job order setting on:

    * Admission to the GPU. Waiting jobs are ranked by class
      (job_priority_data: interactive, yours, background), by how far the
      person moved them on the Activity page, and, for background work, by
      how long they have waited. Only the head of the line may try to claim
      the card; the rest keep waiting in their own loops.
    * Interactive work first. Interactive tickets head the GPU line. While a
      chat or voice turn runs, and for INTERACTIVE_GRACE_S after it,
      background work does not claim the GPU, and background jobs already
      running pause at their safe points (yield_point). Yours work does not
      wait for a turn: a turn can itself wait on a render it asked for (a
      single-image upscale, a storyboard regenerate), and making that render
      wait for the turn would deadlock both.
    * Nothing running is stopped. A job that holds the GPU keeps it until it
      ends; a higher-class job waits for the release like everyone else.
    * A swarm agent's GPU hold. A job that would unload Ollama's models waits
      while an agent holds one, unless the person presses Run now for it.
    * Idle box for nightly work (box_idle).

With the setting off every entry point is a pass-through: no ledger is read
or written, nothing waits, and the order is exactly what each queue does by
itself.

The ledger is a JSON file under pids/, guarded by an advisory flock on a
sidecar file, the same pattern as the cross-process GPU lease
(gpu_resource_coordinator). Every ticket records the process that owns it;
tickets of processes that are gone are dropped on the next read.
