"""GPU/generation-activity checks for autoresearch politeness.

An overnight research run must never fight the user's image/video generation
for the GPU. The signals:

- The cross-process GPU lease (pids/gpu_lock.json), which every heavy GPU job
  holds while it runs: renders, image and music generation, upscales, LoRA and
  model training (gpu_resource_policy.gpu_session(cross_process=True)).
- An active ComfyUI job (its queue endpoint reports running items), which
  covers work started in ComfyUI itself.
- VRAM pressure via nvidia-smi (same probe pattern as the swarm plugin's
  resource monitor), checked between experiments only.

Each probe fails soft to "not busy": a broken probe must not permanently stall
research.
