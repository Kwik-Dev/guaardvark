LlamaIndex Code Manipulation Tools for LLM Self-Improvement
Provides FunctionTools compatible with ReActAgent for code reading, searching, and editing.

These tools enable an LLM agent to:
1. Read source code files
2. Search for patterns across the codebase
3. Edit code files with automatic backups
4. List project structure
5. Run tests to verify changes

Milestone Goal: Enable LLM to remove "Snibbly Nips" button from SettingsPage.jsx
