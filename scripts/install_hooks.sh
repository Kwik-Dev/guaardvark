# Install this clone's git hooks: the portability guard (what leaves) and the
# inbound guard (what arrives).
#
#   pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push      symlinks to the tracked scripts, so a
#                                         change to them applies at once
#   pre-merge-commit, reference-transaction
#                                         copies, plus a pinned copy of the
#                                         inbound engine in
#                                         <git-common-dir>/inbound-guard/engine
#
# The inbound hooks run from a copy on purpose: incoming code is judged by the
# engine installed here, never by the version it carries. After a change to the
# inbound guard has been read and accepted, run this again to adopt it.
#
# The inbound guard does nothing until a mode is set:
#   git config inboundguard.mode observe   record verdicts and print findings
#   git config inboundguard.mode enforce   also refuse a held merge until approved
#
# Every worktree shares one hooks directory, so this installs for all of them.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install_hooks.sh           install or update
#   scripts/install_hooks.sh --check   report whether what is installed matches
#                                      the tracked hooks and engine (exit 1 if not)
